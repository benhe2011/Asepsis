    <p class='mission-content'> Asepsis was built in response to the recent fires and lack of air quality in California. Our main goal is to compile helpful resources to educate students on air quality levels and protection methods. We hope that this website will better inform students of the areas affected by poor air quality and serve as a resource for the betterment of their health.</p>
